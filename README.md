# oxford-bus-times
A super-simple web page that displays the upcoming buses for a particular stopcode.

There's a working version at http://ihatemornings.com/bus and you can specify the stopcode like this: http://ihatemornings.com/bus/?stopcode=69323289

You can find the stopcode numbers by searching for the stop on the home page of [the Oxontime site](http://www.oxontime.com/). Once you pick a stop the stopcode appears in the URL of the page, like this: `http://www.oxontime.com/#69323629`. Or if you're at the bus stop, it's the "text this number to blah" number beginning with `69`.
